# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
Labels help provide a label for inputs and it's easier than positioning with css. With a label, it is almost always connected to an input or whichever element you would need a label for. One way to associate a label with an input is to nest it inside:
```html
<label>
  Username
  <input type="text" name="username" />
</label>
```
Or to include the "for" attribute within the label, with the same name as the id of the input:

```html
<label for="username-input">Username</label>
<input id="username-input" type="text" name='username' />
```
