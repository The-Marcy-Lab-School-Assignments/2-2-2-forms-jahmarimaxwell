# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
This is because when a form is submitted, they automatically get used and redirect to the next page. The browser's web address changes to the value of the input of each label. To prevent the form from doing so, you use the preventDefault method.

Your explanation is on the right track, but it would benefit from more clarity about the default behavior of form submission.
